# Vagrant LAMP Stack Setup Script Documentation

## Introduction

This script is designed to automate the setup of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) 
stack on two virtual machines (VMs) created using Vagrant. The two VMs are referred to as the "Master" and 
"Slave" nodes. Additionally, the script allows for SSH key-based authentication between the nodes,
 data transfer from the Master to the Slave, and provides an overview of the running processes on the Master node.

## Prerequisites

Before executing the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed on your local machine.
2. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or another supported Vagrant provider installed.
3. The Vagrant box "ubuntu/focal64" should be added. If not, the script will automatically add it.

## Script Execution

Follow these steps to execute the script:

1. **Download and Prepare the Script**

   - Download the script to your local machine.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

2. **Execute the Script**

   - Run the script with the following command:

     ```bash
     bash vagrant_lamp_setup.sh
     ```

   The script will begin the setup process, which includes the following steps:

3. **Master Node Setup**

   - The script creates the "Master" VM with the IP address specified in `MASTER_IP`.
   - It installs a LAMP stack on the Master node, ensuring that Apache is running and set to start on boot.
   - The MySQL installation is secured, and a default user and password are set.
   - PHP functionality with Apache is validated.
   - An overview of running processes on the Master node is displayed.

4. **SSH Key-Based Authentication Setup**

   - An SSH key is generated for the "altschool" user on the Master node.
   - The public key is copied to the "Slave" node, allowing for passwordless SSH access.

5. **Data Transfer**

   - The script transfers the contents of the `/mnt/altschool` directory from the Master node to
    `/mnt/altschool/slave` on the Slave node using the "altschool" user.

6. **Slave Node Setup**

   - The script creates the "Slave" VM with the IP address specified in `SLAVE_IP`.
   - It installs a LAMP stack on the Slave node, similar to the Master node setup.

7. **Finalization**

   - Once the setup is complete, the script returns you to the parent directory.

8. **Clean Up and SSH Access**

   - You can access the "Master" node by running the following command:

     ```bash
     vagrant ssh -c "cd /vagrant/master && vagrant ssh"
     ```

   This command will SSH into the "Master" node.

## Configuration and Customization

You can customize this script by modifying the values in the script,
 such as `UBUNTU_VERSION`, `MASTER_IP`, and `SLAVE_IP`, to match your requirements.

## Security Considerations

Ensure you follow security best practices when setting up SSH key-based authentication and 
securing your MySQL installation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the script execution, 
make sure that you meet the prerequisites, and double-check the configuration values.
